This is a sample graph application that is setup to connect with the Spring Boot REST service found here: [pkmn-firebase-springboot-api](https://github.com/Silidos/pkmn-firebase-springboot-api)

The implementation is using GraphQL-Java kickstart. The Graph API will be spun up on port 5022 and assumes that
the REST API will be on at port 8080.
